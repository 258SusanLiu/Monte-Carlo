# Monte-Carlo

A castle sits on top of a cliff. An amateur band of merceneries is attempting to destroy it.

Normally this would be a pretty straightforward geometric calculation, but these are amateurs. What makes them amateurs you ask? It's because they are not very good at estimating distances, and not very good at aiming their cannon. They can only determine the 5 input parameters within certain ranges.

Your job is to figure out the probability that these doofuses will actually hit the castle. This is a job for multicore Monte Carlo simulation!
